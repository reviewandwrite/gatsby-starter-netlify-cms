description: >+
  Being back feels awkward. Life changes a little in seven months, give or take.
  The limbo is done, my integrity is still tight. 




  (I’m only 47 percent sure)


  Had to inevitably start with a very mushy, unfortunately non-naturalistic piece of fiction, to remind both of us about the caliber we crave. Unlike Hazelwood, I give zero shits about “lying to impressionable youths about the durability of human relationships.” Especially, when it comes to making a living out of it.

Did ***“Love On The Brain”*** extend the longevity of Love on my brain? *`Duh.`* 


> I don't know why we keep doing this to ourselves.

To construe this articulate paragon, a ***SPOILER ALERT*** shall now be in effect. 



> ### ***“The real villain is love: an unstable isotope constantly undergoing spontaneous nuclear decay. And it will forever go unpunished.”***
>

> #### ***“Permanence and love are clearly incompatible, so now I'm focusing on my career.”***



Ali did a great job of getting me out of the worst reading slump I could ever be in. 

Nonetheless, she’s back with a bang, and it’s as plain as a pikestaff that I fell in love again. 

***`TOO BITS.`***



I am tantalized by the wordplay. It is punning and giving, and I sunk in it transiently and terribly. 

There’s no reverse gear now.

> #### *`Academia for the love of god has been a detrimental detail of my almost 20 years of viability.`* 



There’s nothing more validating the author can do, other than to ***simply gambol and create poetry.***



> I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS BOOK.



> ### ***“Did you un-fence the Bee-fence?”***
>
>

I think I say it on behalf of all of us when I tell you that *Bee* was intricate, seasoned, tricky and a literary fairy. 

*`Her constitution and disposition would make anybody fall in irresistible, unprecedented love.`* 

Shielded, mysterious, complicated but very zendaya-ey? 

With a lot of different hair colors, which I dig. 

> ##### ABSO-FU*KING-LUTELY.



Qualities that none of us would mind incorporating, qualities we still wouldn't be able to carry.



> #### *`I’m loud and I throw a tantrum every now and then. It’s a no-fence situation, sorry.`*



The best part about this is it’s not written in third person, and I got a kick out of that every single time. Unlike [Love Hypothesis.](https://www.reviewandwrite.com/blog/2022-10-22-the-love-hypothesis-ali-hazelwood/) 

> *`Phew.`*



> ### ***“Vegan donuts are for vegans, you absolute walnut.”***



Jaw-wide-open amusement on the transparent and genius use of cuss. 

Jaw-wide-open amusement on the head bashing creation of fictional masterpieces. 

Every. Single. Character. 



> Especially Rocio. 
>
> And Reike.
>
> And maybe even Kaylee. 



All things considered. 



> #### ***`Bearing in mind the nature of the novel and my capacity to couple, I’d drop my vanquishing calling for a homosapien as gifted as Bee in the blink of an eye.`*** 



Just kidding. My world does not revolve around validation from the opposite sex. 

`(of course it does)`



We all get you, Levi. 

Also, I love Levi. regardless of the fact ***that he’s too tall for space, loves star wars and will spend half his life taking care of a kitten.*** 



He’s as mushy as a duck, and we’d follow him around exactly like little ducklings.



> ### ***“My lifelong dream is living in a pretty brick home with two point five kids and a yard to grow butterfly friendly plants.”***



Notice how there’s always this one character in every novel who secretly wishes to have the life crafted out of a fairy tale and ends up having the most chaotically indifferent identity.



> ***`It’s psychotic. I love it.`***



I love flowers, but it demands allegiance. 

I love pets, but they demand handiness. 

I love academia, but it demands zeal.

I love tattoos, and red hair and clothes big enough to fit a 6’7 built male physique. But all of this is inconsistent, debilitating and requires 10 to 15 calls to mom in a week.



#### *`We’re all mismanaged buffoons and absolutely get where women in STEM come from.`* 



> ### ***“Humans don't need cognitive enhancement when it comes to killing each other.”***
>
>

Yes, but they do need a lot of wine. It’s as if they need cognitive degeneration to commence a highly disintegrating act. 

*`Damaging, unraveling, infuriating`* but in the mildest corners of their heads, stupidly rewarding. 



> *Whoever said we’re simple species, take it up with god, he created monsters in the worst shades of skin.*
>
>

In other news (towards the end of optimism) I am yet again Intimidated by Bee. A fictional character. 



> ### ***“You could rip me to shreds, Bee.”***



I have the softest, cuddliest, spongiest corner in my heart for romanticism.

And I am absolutely in awe of the “summery” ones.



> *`Oh god, I’ll melt.`* 

We didn't exactly decode a lot about Levi’s personality, truth be told, just that he couldn't get over his crush, when he really should have gotten a psych evaluation. 

(he is immensely cute)



Massive self control however. 



> ***Platonic-ity? BORING.***



> #### ***“Men who are physical, elemental, Masculine, Present, Solid.”***



> ***`Men who are written by women.`***



> ### ***“We’re only humans, we’re full of “why’s” drowning in “why’s”. Every once in a while we need a bit of “because” and if it is not readily available, we make it up.”***
>
>

A sorry spot check for those who are `stuck, reminiscing, sadly nostalgic, hurting, messy. `

Sometimes, reasoning with inevitability knicks your bricks more than the cement you want to hold it with. 

> *(Gen-z is complicated.)*



> ###  ***“Science doesn't give a shit, science is reliable in it’s variability. Science does whatever the fuck it wants.”***
>
>

The roots of Statistics and science are undoubtedly carved in permanence. 

Right? 

Wrong. 

> *Anybody chasing lab rats or algorithms, making drugs or prescriptions, knows how beautiful it is, and also how ugly it is.*



It waits for no-one. It’s a whole concept needing nothing. 

*`It’s a shapeshifter.`*



I love literature, I loved this one, it dragged me out of a limbo that god knew I needed to be dragged out of

`It’s personal, the liking. It reminded me of something. `

*I’m biased today.*

It’s a *`5/5`*



> ***Ali,***
