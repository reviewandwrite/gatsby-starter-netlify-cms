title: VERITY- By Colleen Hoover

description: >
  There’s something about Colleen Hoover’s books in bookshops and libraries that
  have an undeniable force pulling money out of my wallet. Not that it wasn't a
  voluntary course of action. But to defend my case, Murphy’s Law legitimized
  major irrational life decisions. 

  Nonetheless, here’s a toast to Booktok’s next most vivid endorsement!

To construe this articulate paragon, a **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** shall now be in effect.

<!--StartFragment-->

> ### ***“The only question that remains is, Which truth was she manipulating?”***

### <!--StartFragment-->

Remember when I said I'm taking an interval of breathing space from [Colleen Hoover](https://www.colleenhoover.com/)? 

Yes, well, Booktok didn't exactly give me the green light. Turns out CoHo has a sizable and an ostensibly greater hold on me than I can possibly have on myself.

Which in turn leads me to question :

> ***What the hell did I just read?***
>
> `Oh boy!`
>
> I unquestionably understand the hype around this book now, and I am unquestionably moved by it to whatever you think should be the highest degree of being moved by a *300 page publication.* 

I could not *`AT ALL`* get myself to wrap my head around any of the given characters.

I sincerely found each and every single one of them to be **thoroughly, utterly and mentally impaled**. Even 5 year old, very anomalous, *Crew Crawford.*

Hey Colleen, please explain the mind of this writer to me. 

Verity very definitely had a subtly impactul appeal with her words. 

> `Lol, scratch subtle.`

Out of the 4 endings that I prophesied in my head after I put this novel under intense scrutiny of my almost vigilant brain at *4am*, it ended exactly NOTHING like I imagined. 

I tried really hard to get into Verity’s shoes, maybe commiserate with her a little. But I just couldn't get myself to think from that parallax. I mean,

> #####  **CAN YOU BLAME ME?** 

<!--StartFragment-->

So instead I tried to get into Jeremy’s shoes, and if the letter was true then, well… 

`commiseration is a model concept that I have now thrown down the drain.`

Even Lowen wasn’t a sorted character, honey she was far from sorted. I mean she did help Jeremy kill a perfectly healthy human being in lieu of what? A conceivably fallacious manuscript? 

I’m not team letter, don’t read this in that virtue. But I’m not team manuscript as well. I’m team **“open ended with plausible explanations.”** (That’s me riding away from solution selection)

<!--StartFragment-->

> ### ***“People are chronics, prone to chronic tragedy. One terrible thing after another”***

<!--StartFragment-->

There is a side that I want to believe and a side that just makes a little more sense.

There is a side that gives us the **“happily ever after”** narrative and a side that elaborates the "**ruin of a family of five."**

So, yes. I am most definitely battling the issue of choosing sides at the moment.

Yes, I’m not very good at it. `(team manuscript ftw)`

> ### ***“I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me”***

I couldn’t quite understand and be on board with Lowen. I couldn't quite establish harmony with her thought process. 

Decide Lowen, are you in the house of

> * *Verity* - who you idolize or
> * *Verity* - whose murder you plan almost as if it’s a side hobby?

The scenes were set so well that I have a `one hundred percent` lucid visualization of all the rooms of *Jeremy Crawford’s* house. 

The tactical unfolding of events also begs me to mention that by the end of it *Ashleigh* got preoccupied with *Jeremy*, a little more than it would be deemed healthy in accordance with my individualized opinion.

I wanted to admire and fix my gaze on this character a little more than I already did but her life’s dramatic chaos stopped me. So instead I drove the wheel around and decided to love Jeremy a little more than I already did, but the letter stopped me. 

> `(Petition for Verity to please not gaslight)`

But at the end of the day, I do feel that Colleen somewhat anticipated this?

##### ***Or maybe I’m just an imbecile downright obsessed with the Author.***

<!--StartFragment-->

Overall, I give this book a good ***`4.5/5`***  Which in all sincerity is parallel to the rating of [“IT ENDS WITH US”](https://www.reviewandwrite.com/blog/2022-08-31-it-ends-with-us/), but I’d still advocate that “Verity” was her best one yet! (Again, personal, distinctive pov)

I’m going to have to give a fair warning of an age rating of ***18+*** on this book! 

> The house was dingy, the plot was petrifying and the characters really needed therapy.

> #### `What else makes a novel more marvelous?`

> *PS. I love how no one was innocent and if caught all would have faced serious jail time.* 

Last but not the least,
