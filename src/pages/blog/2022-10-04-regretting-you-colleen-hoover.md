title: Regretting You- Colleen Hoover

description: >+
  We’re starting the month with obviously, the obvious! At this point, I openly
  admit that I’ve taken a huge “in love” fall from the top of some huge
  building. It’s doom I’ve fallen into. A money splurging, emotional pit of
  doom. And there’s no coming out. So, instead of wriggling my way out, I’ll
  nestle my way in.

I thought this novel would be `poetic`. I thought it would be everything that any other fiction novel is on any other day. I started reading this paperback with the expectations of just any other average fabrication, until it started hitting home and came so close to the actuality of me existing as me.



`I knew I was a goner the moment the book first made me clench my chest- within ‘word for word’ twenty minutes. And I also knew that the reverse gear was a no-brainer. `



> ### I think i have been had. 



Every second of this novel, you’ll be waiting for the other shoe to drop.



***And then it will.***



> ## ***“Because right now, my energy is pent up. I feel swollen with it as I think about how much I want a new kitchen door.”***

Every time I saw the novel lying on my shelf, waiting to be read, I had seventeen different kinds of theories establishing a synonymous and meaningful thought behind why it’s named [*“Regretting You”*,](https://www.colleenhoover.com/portfolio/regretting-you/) until I actually read it and just when the title started to make more and more sense, the author sent me down spiraling, more and more.



There was no such thing as “reading for romance” in this novel.

If you have read this novel, you’d know what this means and if you haven't read this novel, you’d know what this means. 

[Hoover](https://www.colleenhoover.com/) is verbally arousing and writes magnificent imagery. 

I can’t possibly cover up my tracks on how much I’m obsessed with her, but every time I pick up a new read by her,

***It's like I discover hidden body parts, like it was all there, I just had to touch it.*** 



###### `A noticeable and fair warning of crying with every chapter is like a designation for this book.`

Chapter 5 made me bawl like a baby and it’s no lie that I bellowed progressively, intensely and continuously.  



> ## ***“Heartbreak builds character.”***



Hold up.

 Take a breather. 

Because I need to acknowledge the pragmatically woven and dynamically beautiful correlation between a suffering mother and an equally broken daughter. 

***It’s invariably as much homely as it’s not.*** 



Only thing that screamed teen flutters and fantasy was *Miller*, an unproportionate and awfully sweet guy.

Between the beginning and middle, there was massive room for an urgent need for character development, and thank god it was met.

`Beautifully, must I add.`



We set examples through this novel and then we met them. Why won’t I be in awe of the writer?



> ## ***“I’m worried we got it wrong.”***



I’m worried that this novel was uncomfortably similar to a lot of our individual perspectives, and I’m worried that there’s no going back from that.



*Jonah* was an out and out sweetheart, I don’t think there was any intention to make him the messiah but he was the comfort character of this book, and who doesn’t love those more than the main ones?



> `My comfort character is also a sad pretty boy with trauma and questionable morals. Wdym I'm not normal?`



He was categorically unreliable but I’m sure he had a good reason :)

`(This was also my most favorite line of the novel.)`



Getting to the end of this review, I’m helplessly spending (or wasting) plethorically large amounts of time to find something to criticize, or something to *pinpoint and pan* from this book and I honestly really can’t.



> ##### **This book is such a `5/5` that I can’t even!**



A big drain was the fact that this book was really too much to take at once. I couldn't read all of it in one go.

***It's like I needed literature processing intervals.*** 



People from BookTok had very loud opinions about Clara. Now I have very loud opinions about people from BookTok. 

Only because Clara did everything that a sixteen year old would, take it from somebody who’s close to that age. *Like I said, there were character building shoes to be filled here and there.* 



> #### `Regretting You by Colleen Hoover is not a light read. It’s sometimes debilitating to the point of intervening yourself and cleaning your weeping. It’s pragmatic. It’s literally so amazing.`



So there it is, [reviewandwrite’s](https://www.reviewandwrite.com/) first **5/5.**



> ## ***“It’s too much. It’s not fair. It's not fair, it’s not fair, it’s not fair.”***

> *\- Clara Grant*  



> #### ***Hoover, It’s too much, it’s not fair.***
