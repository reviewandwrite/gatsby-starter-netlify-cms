  This in time’s fullness is Elena Armas’s first Book, and in my heart’s
  fullness, beneath the same depth, is utter admiration for a first attempt!
  This Book has a subsequently high potential to linger on you for quite some

To construe this articulate paragon, a ***SPOILER ALERT*** shall now be in effect.

> ### ***“Would I ever be so head over heels, crazy in love that everything else would fade to a black noise?”***

As very vividly mentioned in my last book review, the idea of *“mutual liking”* has never made me quiz the foundation of the human framework. But after this book? hmm…. 

The readers can’t exactly exit this lulling and dreamy world created by the very consummate author *Elena Armas* and carry on with life once again heedlessly. Or do we let in the idea of some version of an “Aaron Blackford” out there and then blame the living hell out of *Elena Armas* for letting us slide into our fantasy fiction?

> `The former seems less possible. :)`

*The consternation of unconditional love inside us will absolutely wreck this said “Generation Z.*”

Why could Elena perforate our walls and inveigle our character in a matter of just seven hours?

> #### `Oh you thought you could put the book down once you start? Lol.`

> ### ***“I’ll give you the world, the moon, the stars. Anything you ask, it’s yours.***
>
>  **\-** *Aaron Blackford* 

Elegant, classy, sleek. Aaron did not talk nonsense, he pointed out facts. Well on that note a very crazy, notable, universally accepted fact is that the readers shall live and die for him if this life could serve him on an attainable platter.

> #### **`The bar of association has been set. Sky high. If I must point out.`**

Among other things, the start of this paperback was a little slow and felt stretched and long drawn considering it already was a slow burn.

I hate to admit it, but the beginning just *wasn't it for me*. The plot didn't feature or revolve around pragmatism at all, it was just two people falling in love, in the most unrealistic way ever, *`Not Cute.`*

> ### ***“I was never unhappy, at least not until I realized that I wasn't completely happy either***
>
>  *\-Aaron Blackford* 

This slow burn fueled us with applause and esteem.

It also conceptualized the existence of some very promising ideals which in reality are mostly just chaos, so that was a bummer.

 *This lulling fictional world, oh god.*

With that said, I rate the book a good ***3/5*** for its delivery, for the magnificent portrayal of the protagonist and for Aaron Blackford.`*fan girl moment*`

In the fullness of time, this book was ultimately a typical contemporary romance that circles around a fake dating trope. Personally, I like the idea of *variable volume* in a book and not simple singular dating tropes. 

Nonetheless, *THE SPANISH LOVE DECEPTION* by *ELENA ARMAS* proved to be a joyous ride.

A light read that I’ll recommend to anybody who’d volunteer to be ruined by romance!

*Elena, you ruined us for any other concocted scenario that our bed time routine may demand.* 

*Elena, you made us feel icky and hot and bothered in no particular order ;)*
