title: It Starts With Us

  Starting the month with Colleen Hoover is not an intention or a forethought or a calculation…

  Just kidding. How else am I supposed to siphon your regard? There’s a lot of endearment and warmth on this side of the boat. It’s visionary, non - naturalistic but above all, fiction. I wasn’t starry eyed by the end of it, but it didn’t let my attention stray at all. This in fact is a promising sequel to Colleen Hoover’s most advocated book, the one that I couldn’t put down even through muscle. Here we go again, Lily.

Atlas and Josh could do a *`‘pop- chips’`* commercial and I’d still feast my eyes on it. Their portrayal is so fancy and cosmopolitan that I’m certain it’s in actuality, a beast sized blip in the matrix. 

Mad esteem to the Author for coming up with titles. They have me throwing my books everywhere.

Um, in all honesty, did we really need a sequel to [“It ends with Us?”](https://www.colleenhoover.com/portfolio/it-ends-with-us/)

As cheap literary critics we loved Ryle, up until he turned domestically… well, nuts. And as those same economic readers, we would have loved to see him get help. 

> #### *`So, quick question. What was the trope again?`* 



I’d love to read this as a standalone with a complete obliteration of my head someday.

*I’d love to become acquainted with the characters in a parallel and sound cosmos.*



> ### ***“Even monsters can’t survive without a heart beating inside their chest.”***



I do not lie when I say ***`Atlas`*** did everybody’s psychotherapy in this one book. *(I saved a lot of bills and my bank account doesn’t look too devastatingly glib)*



We genuinely needed more detail on wherever the hell he came from. It really was that. *`Hell.`* 

> #### *`Giving authentic strength to Unauthentic/fictional characters, woohoo.`*



> ### ***“You’re a privilege, Josh. Believe me, if I’d known you existed, I would have knocked over buildings for you”***



Most of us fall within the same age bracket.

 The bracket where we’re still dumb but not too dumb, where we understand realism but not really, where we wish for wishful thinking but end up clawed in dismal chains of misfortune.

In Obligation, the plot was charming. But *Kincaid* went down without a fight? I refuse to believe that, *`that’s a pending court case right there.`* 

Thank God the ending wasn’t another sequel of *‘playing eminem on repeat.’* 



I don’t know what I pictured at the prospect of a continuation novel. It wasn't so supremely butterflies infused however. It wandered away from what Colleen naturally writes.



[Wait, she writes everything. Phew. ](https://www.colleenhoover.com/)



> ### ***“It’s “Asshole” Josh, one word. ”***



I will not underestimate twelve year olds after this novel. They are godly supreme and every single one of them is way out of my league. 



`The Corrigan family tree will grow branches beneath surfaces, through the air and above expectations. `



Based on how it felt a little anticlimactic to me to not even mention *Ryle* more than all of three times, and how everything was sunshine and spring this year, ***it’s a gorgeous gorgeous `3/5`***

Idk if it is my hopelessness or my audacity, 

###### `but 1000 bucks to whoever says that to me next, okay bye.`
