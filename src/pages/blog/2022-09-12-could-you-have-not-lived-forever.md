This air surrounding the mattress we wrap ourselves in,

Has started to break more bones to ashes than build ashes to bones.

Who do we condemn however? 

An absolute fate of feat? 

Or the distinctive, inevitable rhythm of the clock?

On your peaceful and righteous departure yesterday, we wait here furiously,

When will you make your presence known again?

Maybe dote can’t liberate the most lost of us ever again,

Maybe that was soulfully just a power sacred to you, 

till you.

Maybe anesthesia could salvage something,

**Can anesthesia salvage something?**



This beacon of light that irradiates the walls we condense ourselves into,

No longer temperates our ices.

It’s orange only nicks our pieces apart,

More, and then some more.

I couldn't vocalize the memory of you without going to rack and ruin,

Your face is embedded in all of our dermises,

In every heart, with love, 

a lot of love.

This house if walked through water and didn't burn in fire,

Couldn't ever equate it’s cementing with the one that you were in.

Because now that it has bled with love and war,

it’s colossally plethoric, 

**It’s prodigiously convalescent**.



By dint of keeping Folklore aside, 

No house could ever plod on ponds and not blow on bombardment,

But Oh! How this one does!

Oh, how your sanctuary walks on wedges, high and higher.

Today in the same air that you once drew breath from,

In the same mattress that you once lay head on,

And in the same Lamp that you turned to see in,

We spread to create and water your favors,

We’re the patrimony of our blood’s eldest, when push comes to shove,

We’re the patrimony of you.

**We walk with pride and burn with brawn.**
