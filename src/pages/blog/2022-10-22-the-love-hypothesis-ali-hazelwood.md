To construe this articulate paragon, a ***SPOILER ALERT*** shall now be in effect.

Soooo, fake dating trope? Mutual beneficiary arrangements? Slow burn?

Subliminally, I’m Olive. Explicitly, I have the same Starbucks order as Olive. 

> *Now, where’s my Adam?*

Contemporary romances feel warm and gentle….

With a lot of racing hearts situation.



This review is going to be short and crisp. I love how it was set in academia, the science lab, the aesthetics, the *“hole”* holing up with lab rats as side hobby (pun intended), I loved the set up, I wasn't fatigued or felt stultified for a single second, throughout the *384* page read. Mildly topsy- turvy, yes. But never boring.



Although….

Did Adam say he was crazy about olive all these years? Then Ali, tell me that not only did he stalk Olive, but also her dead, pancreatic cancer infused, poor rats.

The events did not quite unfold the way I intended for them to. Now, don't get me wrong, I’m all for a hoaxed dating trope, but a substantial part of the plot felt like it finished almost right when it started. 



The writing in third person, threw me off. Big time. I felt severed from the emotional capacities of the main characters, bummer. 

#### *`However, emotionally, I loved the diabetic drinks, so definite plus points for that.`*



> ### ***“I take it back, you’re a disturbingly cheap date.”***



Olive is dangerously relatable, I’m intimidated by her. By a fictional character.



> `FML`



> ### ***“I’m absolutely nothing to you, so it doesn't make any sense that you’d have a personality transplant anytime you’re in my presence”***

Come to think of it, Adam was mysteriously amusing. The best part? He splurged. Like real money in a fictional world. That’s something right? XD



The ride was joyous, I was more or less hooked, except the burn was too slow and it didn't quite hit all the right places. With this, I give The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood, a rating of` 3/5.`

It was intricate and serious and laughable and progressive and **JUST EPIC.**

> #### ***Hazelwood, you smart ass.***
